# DCU Loop - Dark Blue

DCU Loop - Dark Blue is a browser extension designed to provide a fresh new theme to the DCU student portal website, making it easier on the eyes in low-light environments. The default site offers only a white theme, which can be too bright to look at, especially at night or in a dark room.

## Features

- Applies a dark blue theme to the DCU Loop portal.
- Automatically activates upon installation.
- Future updates may include additional features like a toggle switch.

## Installation

DCU Loop - Dark Blue is available on the Chrome Web Store. To install it:

1. Go to the extension on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dcu-loop-dark-blue-beta/iobbaabplpaenpaobophecajphimjopj).
2. Click "Add to Chrome".

Once installed, the student website should automatically switch to the dark blue theme.
